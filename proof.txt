-available preinstalled on almost every linux distro/macOS
-there are a lot of useful commands that are easy to remember (or not)
-you dont need a mouse :) 
-fast 
-you can flex to your friends (if you have) that you know how to use vim

- d {number} {motion} - delete
- r,R -replace 
- c -change
- ctrl + G - file details
- gg/G -page navigation
- /, ? -word search
- u, U, ctrl+R -undo commands
- % -matching parantheses search
- s/old/new - substitute command (%s for the whole file or #,# to specify lines range, /g for global substitute /gc for prompt)
- 0 -start of a line
- :! external command execution
